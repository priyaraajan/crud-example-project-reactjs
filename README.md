#Chef's Library
<hr>

This is an app which can perform functions like **creating** data and **updating** it ,**deleting** it, and retrieve it from a database.
This app even has **registration** and **login** functionality where it authorizes users and allow to access the available data and view ,edit or delete it .
This app was totally built using **ReactJS** and for the database storage **Firebase** is used.
The Authorization mechanism uses the Firebase Authorization services.

PS: I am new to ReactJS and have somehow managed to build this app with my core knowledge on the concepts of react
    and it might have some minor errors and mistakes.Please kindly bear with it.
